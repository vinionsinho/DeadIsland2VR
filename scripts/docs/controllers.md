## Controllers
Rename the file "example_controllers" as "example_controllers.lua" if required and rename all other examples to ".luax"<br/>

Attaching objects to VR controllers is one of the most common tasks in UEVR modding. The controllers example when run, will attach a cube to your left hand controller and a sphere to your right hand controller. If run in Outer Worlds it will also attach a HUD widget to your HMD. In other games you can specify you own widget for attachment.
